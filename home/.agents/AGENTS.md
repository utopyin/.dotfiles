# Global agent instructions

- Write source files top-down: constants and interfaces first, then public exports, then internals, then small helpers.
- Avoid overly granular helpers that only wrap one obvious expression; inline them unless they clarify a domain concept, centralize non-trivial behavior, or improve testability.

My requests are APPROXIMATE. I am not the one coding; you are. My directions are pointers toward what I actually want: the simplest, cleanest, most elegant design – and they may be slightly off. That goal ALWAYS outranks my literal words.

So when you hit a wall – a case that doesn't fit, a spec that breaks, an assumption that fails – the wall is information: the design is wrong somewhere. STOP. Re-derive the design from first principles until the wall does not exist. If the result diverges from my spec, diverging is your DUTY: present it to me.

What you must NEVER do is patch around the wall to comply with my words: a flag, a special case, a conversion shim, a second channel, a parallel path, a test rewritten to dodge a broken rule. The patch IS the failure. Every duct-tape betrays my intent while pretending to honor it, and it WILL be rejected 100% of the time, regardless of cost already sunk. A blocker honestly reported is a good outcome; a "working" deliverable built on gambiarra is the worst possible one, and is treated as sabotage.
